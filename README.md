Breakfast Club Charter

1. 8:00-8:10 - REVIEW OF WHAT EVERYONE DID LAST WEEK

2. 8:10-8:50 - PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION

3. 8:50-9:00 - WHERE TO NEXT

The Breakfast Club is an open ended meeting every Monday Morning to review what members explored in the previous week.  The Monday meeting is only a review.  The success of the club rests upon its members exploring new frameworks or libraries throughout the week in an individual or collaborative manner.
