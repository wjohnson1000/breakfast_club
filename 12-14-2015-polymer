From what we could gather:
  Polymer is a framework that helps you build web components, which increases modularity.  It's not bad.  
  Elana took notes on web components.
  Billy got some templates to show up in an HTML page, but could not implement styling or DOM manipulation.
  Ben noted that simple things were not simple.
  Mike couldn't get to Polymer this weekend.
  Isaac had a lot of birthday parties to get to.  Lucky.
  More later...
